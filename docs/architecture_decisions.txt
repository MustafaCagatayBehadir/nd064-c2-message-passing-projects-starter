Architecture Design Decisions
------------------------------------------------------
Three message passing techniques are used:
- REST APIs
- Message Queues (Kafka)
- gRPC

The frontend client uses REST API calls to backend services. It is straightforward to keep using REST API for the frontend client to backend services
interaction. REST API is widely used in the industry because of its scalability and flexibility.

gRPC was chosen as the mode of message passing for ingesting large volume of location data from the mobile devices. Mobile devices can integrate well with gRPC 
without an intermediary proxy to the backend service. gRPC is using HTTP/2 as a transport which is a more secure and performant way of making HTTP requests 
that is backwards compatible. gRPC uses protobufs to pass its messages. Protobufs are designed to be serialized into binary blobs, making it very efficient to 
transport our data "over the wire" through a network.

The location ingester service utilizes a message queue (Kafka) to handle the ingested location data. Message queues are a good fit when we are working with 
real-time data processing.
